Dear ○○,

This is from the staff for the Ruby 25th anniversary event.
Ruby was born on the 24th of February, 1993, so this will be the 25th birthday.
We will hold an event celebrating Ruby, and talking about Ruby's past, present, and future on the 24th of February 2018 in Tokyo.
We're also holding an event on the web to collect messages for Ruby from Rubyists around the world. We know how busy you are, but we'd like to ask you to write a message for Ruby and Rubyists! We are planning to open the messages web pages on Feb 1st.

## About the message

About Ruby
We don't have a constraint on the details of the message,
but it's good to write about the past, present, or future.

However, the event has a code of conduct, and it applies to the messages too.
